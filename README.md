# Task4_lstm

##  Overview

This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to learn patterns in text data and generate new text that looks similar to the training data.

For example, if trained on poetry, it can generate poetry-like sentences.

---

##  What It Does

- Takes a dataset of text (like stories, articles, or poems)
- Learns patterns in sequences of words or characters
- Generates new text that mimics the style of the original input

---

##  Why It's Useful

- Understand how deep learning can model sequences
- Create creative text, poems, or code suggestions
- Learn how memory-based networks (like LSTM) work

---

## âš™ How It Works (Simple Steps)

1. Load and clean a large text dataset
2. Split text into sequences (input and target)
3. Train an LSTM model on these sequences
4. Use the trained model to generate new text one character or word at a time

---

##  Tools Used

- Python 
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch
